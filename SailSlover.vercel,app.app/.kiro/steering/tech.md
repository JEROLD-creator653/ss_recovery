# Technology Stack

## Framework & Build System
- Next.js (App Router architecture)
- Vercel deployment platform
- Webpack bundler

## Frontend Technologies
- React (server and client components)
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- CSS Modules and global styles

## Fonts & Typography
- Geist Sans (custom font family, weights 100-900)
- Geist Mono (monospace font, weights 100-900)
- Poppins (Google Fonts - weights 300, 500, 600)
- Font display strategy: swap for optimal loading

## Analytics & Monetization
- Google Analytics (GA4 - tracking ID: G-F7WR3HX216)
- Google AdSense (publisher ID: ca-pub-9564119438996773)
- Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights

## Styling Approach
- CSS custom properties for theming (light/dark mode support)
- Glassmorphism design pattern (backdrop-filter blur effects)
- Responsive design with viewport-based units
- Font fallback strategies for performance

## Common Commands
Since this is a deployed static site snapshot, typical Next.js commands would be:
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## Performance Optimizations
- Font preloading for critical fonts
- Async script loading for third-party resources
- CSS precedence optimization
- Static asset optimization through Next.js
